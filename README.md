## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/indy-stack/404-not-found-master/blob/main/my-answer.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- The demo for this project can be seen at https://indy-stack.github.io/404-not-found-master/
notice that the solutions I provided were for mobile (375x949) and laptop(1440x1080) and it might not display correctly
in some instances. I had alot of fun creating this simple design but I also had some complications with alignments and
navigating the specifications given in the figma file. Something new that I learned which I did not use much was the flex
property( e.g, shrink, grow) in order to align the elemets in main as well as the footer to the bottom of the page. I did not get
creative with this challenge since I wanted to see if I could follow a figma file and follow the design as close as possible.
